# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
``C`` ``Algorithm``
## Concepts
* Search algorithm
* Space complexity

search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. It work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure.<br/>
web search problems are generally focused on filtering and finding documents highly relevant to human quesries.

Space Complexity:<br/>
Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm<br/>
The Space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm w.r.t the input size. This includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
